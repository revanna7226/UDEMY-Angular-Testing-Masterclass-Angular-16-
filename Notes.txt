In the next few component tests, we are going to be using certain CSS classes to query the DOM and retrieve elements from it, in order to run test assertions.
Some of those CSS classes have changed over the years, with newer releases of Angular Material.
All the content in the video still applies and is valid for the latest Angular
But it you are coding along and want to run the tests yourself, you should use the CSS classes on the right, instead of the ones on the left:

mat-tab-label => mdc-tab
mat-tab-body-active  => mat-mdc-tab-body-active
mat-card-title  => mat-mdc-card-title

Other than the name of CSS classes, everything in the course remains valid.

// component types

- Presentational component - CoursesCardListComponent
- Smarter / Container Component - HomeComnponent
